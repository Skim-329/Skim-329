## Hello there! üëã
My name is Simon and I am a front end developer with a passion for creating projects with a focus on design, education, and community! I am keenly interested in learning how things work and excel at breaking things down into their simplest parts to effectively learn and understand various objects. I am also very passionate about photography for its ability to capture everyday moments. üì∏
